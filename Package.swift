/*
 üèóÔ∏è PACKAGE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
 
 1. SWIFT VERSION (5.7):
    - Enables async/await for modern networking
    - Supports structured concurrency
    - Compatible with Xcode 14+ and recent iOS versions
    - Balances modern features with broad compatibility
 
 2. PLATFORM STRATEGY:
    - iOS 13+: Minimum for async/await and URLSession improvements
    - macOS 10.15+: Catalyst apps and desktop networking
    - tvOS/watchOS: Complete Apple ecosystem coverage
 
 3. ZERO DEPENDENCIES:
    - Pure Swift/Foundation implementation
    - No version conflicts with host applications
    - Smaller binary size and faster compilation
    - Enhanced security through reduced attack surface
 
 4. TARGET STRUCTURE:
    - Single library target for simplicity
    - Comprehensive test suite for reliability
    - Clear separation between framework and tests
